# Recipe: A Pure Rust Recipe Webserver
Tommy Trakoolthai 2025-05

Uses a Tokio/Axum/Askama/Sqlx/Sqlite stack to serve food recipes.

# Build and Run

By default the joke database URI is
`sqlite://db/knock-knock.db`. You can override this with the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable or with the `--db-uri`
command-line argument.

To build and run this code for the first time, you will
probably want:

    cargo run --release -- --init-from assets/static/jokes.json

This will load an initial collection of jokes into the
newly-created database.

## Development

For working on the code, you will want to

    cargo install sqlx-cli`

* `sqlx` migrations are turned on, with reverse
  sequential migrations. Add a migration called `<name>` with

        sqlx migrate add -r -s <name>

  and then edit the migration files.

* `sqlx` compile-time checking of queries against
  the database schemas is turned on. If you modify the
  database schemas or the queries in the source code, please
  run

        sqlx prepare

  to update things so that users can compile before the
  database is built and migrated.

Because of the above you may need to

    git add .sqlx migrations

before committing to ensure things are up to date.
